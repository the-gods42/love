# lOVING YOU
Someone once asked me, “What is love?”  
And when I thought deeply, I realized that love is a beautiful thing to begin with.

It is the first step to freedom, the journey to success.
It means having someone you can truly lean on when you are down—
a source of encouragement along your path,
the fuel that keeps your journey alive.

Even when everything seems impossible,
love is someone who gives you the courage to keep going.
And in the next life,
in will alway chooose you,AJIKE MI.
